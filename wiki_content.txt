### Common Issues

**1. Bot is online but not responding?**
*   Check if the bot has the `Administrator` permission.
*   Ensure you are using the correct prefix (`s?`).
*   Check the console for errors.

**2. "Missing Permissions" Error?**
*   The bot's role must be **higher** than the user/role it is trying to manage in the Server Settings > Roles list.

**3. Database Errors?**
*   Delete `data/bot.sqlite` (Warning: Resets data) to regenerate the database if it's corrupted.
