                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted);">5.3 No Waiver. Imperium's failure to enforce any right or
                        provision of this Agreement shall not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The

                        circumstances, Imperium reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to blacklist said User's
                        Discord account and permanently ban the User from accessing all Imperium Services.</p>

                        SUBSCRIPTION TERMS</h3>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 10px;">7.1 Purchase of License. By purchasing a
                        subscription or making a one-time payment for the Services, the User is granted a non-exclusive,
                        revocable license to access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement. This license
                        is non-transferable, meaning it may not be assigned, sold, or otherwise transferred to another
                        individual or entity. However, as outlined in Section 8, the User is entitled to one (1) free
                        transfer of the Bot to a different Discord server. The Services are available either through a
                        monthly subscription plan or a fixed one-time payment license, as specified at the time of
                        purchase.</p>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted);">7.2 Agreement to Terms. The purchase or use of the Services,
                        whether through a subscription or one-time payment, constitutes the User’s explicit
                        acknowledgment and agreement to be bound by all terms and conditions set forth in this
                        Agreement. The User must comply with all provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited
                        to Section 10 (Service Availability and Termination), as a condition of accessing and using the
                        Services.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: white; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.5rem;">8. TRANSFERS
                    </h3>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 10px;">8.1 Subscription Transfer Policy. Each
                        User subscription includes one (1) free transfer of the Bot to a different Discord server. Any
                        additional transfers beyond the initial free transfer shall require the purchase of a new
                        subscription for the Bot.</p>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 10px;">8.2 Management Discretion. Any additional
                        transfers or overrides beyond the initial free transfer are subject to the sole discretion of
                        Imperium's management. Such discretionary transfers shall not be construed as an entitlement to
                        additional free transfers.</p>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 10px;">8.3 No Liability for Server Termination.
                        Imperium shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or inconvenience resulting from the deletion
                        or
                        termination of a User's Discord server by Discord or any other third party.</p>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted);">8.4 Irreversibility of Transfers. Once a transfer of the Bot to
                        a new Discord server has been completed, the transfer is final and cannot be undone.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: white; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.5rem;">9. THIRD-PARTY
                        RELATIONSHIPS AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</h3>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 10px;">9.1 No Agency Relationship. Imperium does
                        not
                        have any affiliation, association, partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship with any
                        Discord servers or communities that purchase or use our Services.</p>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 10px;">9.2 Independent Actions. Users acknowledge
                        and agree that Imperium exercises no control over the conduct, actions, content, information, or
                        data of third parties using our Services.</p>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted);">9.3 Disclaimer of Liability for Third-Party Actions. Imperium
                        expressly disclaims any and all liability for actions, conduct, statements, or content created,
                        posted, or otherwise generated by any Discord server, community, or individual User of our
                        Services. Such actions and content are the sole responsibility of the respective User or server
                        administrator, and not attributable to Imperium under any legal theory including but not limited
                        to
                        agency, partnership, or vicarious liability.</p>

                        AVAILABILITY AND TERMINATION</h3>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 10px;">10.1 Non-Guaranteed Availability. Imperium
                        does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted, or secure access to our Services. Operation of the
                        Services may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.</p>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 10px;">10.2 Discretionary Service Provision.
                        Imperium reserves the absolute right, in its sole discretion, to refuse service, terminate
                        accounts, or remove or edit content if Imperium determines, in its sole judgment, that a User's
                        conduct violates applicable law, threatens the integrity of the Services, potentially exposes
                        Imperium to legal liability, or otherwise conflicts with Imperium's business interests.</p>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 10px;">10.3 Right to Terminate. Imperium reserves
                        the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate User's access to and use of the Services
                        immediately without prior notice or liability for any reason, including but not limited to a
                        breach of this Agreement.</p>
                    <p style="color: var(--text-muted);">10.4 Survival of Terms. All provisions of this Agreement which
                        by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without
                        limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
